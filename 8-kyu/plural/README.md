<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/52ceafd1f235ce81aa00073a/train/rust target="_blank">Plural</a></h2><h3>8 kyu</h3><p>We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. This would be useful when printing out a string such as <code>5 minutes</code>, <code>14 apples</code>, or <code>1 sun</code>. </p><blockquote><p>You only need to worry about english grammar rules for this kata, where anything that isn't singular (one of something), it is plural (not one of something).</p></blockquote><p>All values will be positive integers or floats, or zero.</p>
