If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is:"Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"</p><p>Ex: Input = "hi" --&gt; Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!(The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)</p><p>Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.</p><p>Please leave feedback for this kata.Cheers!</p>
